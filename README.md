# The-Playroom
 
The Playroom is an exciting Mixed Reality project developed for Meta Quest 3, 3S and Pro headsets, created by a team of Bogdan Livanov, Maria  Andberger and Tomas Joanson in just two weeks. The project showcases three distinct interactive experiences that leverage the power of Mixed Reality:

* A dynamic shooting range that tests precision and accuracy
* An engaging can-smashing game that brings physical interactions into mixed reality
* An educational solar system experience combined with a ring-tossing challenge
* The development approach focused on simplicity and clear scope, with each student owning their specific gameplay area. This modular structure allowed for parallel development and efficient use of the limited two-week timeline.

Role-based development, with each student responsible for their specific gameplay area, ensured a clear division of labor and efficient use of the limited two-week timeline.

**Bogdan Livanov:**
Developed the shooting range, implementing precision aiming and scoring mechanics, projetmanagement and source control.

> I did try to use SOLID principles for the project as well setup source control and project management LFS for the project.

**Tomas Joanson:**
Created the can-smashing game, implementing physics-based interactions and user feedback, as well as give ideas for the project.

**Maria Andberger:**
Developed the educational solar system experience, ring-tossing challenge, and provided feedback on the project as well as managing the project's documentation and presentation.

### The technical implementation utilizes:

* Unity 2022.3.45f1 for game development
* Meta XR All in-one SDK for Mixed Reality interactions
* Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for optimized graphics
* GitHub for version control and collaboration
* Miro for project management and task tracking

This streamlined tech stack and organized development approach demonstrates effective project planning and execution, resulting in a collection of focused, enjoyable Mixed Reality experiences that showcase different interaction patterns and gameplay mechanics.

The project successfully balances technical innovation with achievable scope, making it an excellent example of focused Mixed Reality development under time constraints.
